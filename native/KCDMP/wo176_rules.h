// WO-176 (A1): the pure rules of keeping a partner's figure out of a quest's arranged fight, by the fight's own context (unit-tested in
// native/tests/wo176_tests.cpp). No engine access here.
//
// A quest that arranges a fight marks every soul it puts into it with the game's own entity contexts while its controller runs (the field
// fight of konecZabomysichValek, souboj_na_poli.xml: SetEntityContext combat_arrangedFight and combat_forceUnarmedWhileInUnarmedSkirmish on
// both groups, IsActive <- the controller's Active; docs/WO-175-findings.md 2). An actor that carries either is in a story fight: the mod
// never adds a figure to its skirmish, never turns it on a figure, never pairs the host with it, never routes a figure's blow into it, and a
// figure already in it is taken out. WO-174's name list (wo174_rules.h) stays as the second net for scenes that set no context.
