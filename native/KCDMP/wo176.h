// WO-176 (A1) -- 0.50.0: a partner's figure stays out of a quest's arranged fight, by the fight's own context (wo176_rules.h).
//
//   kept_out(eid, site): the single question every keep-out site asks (hits::scene_owned_eid -- WO-121's skirmish add and raw blow, WO-132's
//     engage, WO-136's retarget and threat, WO-163's pair, WO-165's lock-on; WO-173's real hit asks it before the engine path): the actor's
//     soul carries combat_arrangedFight or combat_forceUnarmedWhileInUnarmedSkirmish (the engine's own context store, read through the WO-143
//     reader -- main thread only; another thread gets the cached answer), else WO-174's name list. Logs, once per actor per 10 s:
//       WO176-ARRANGED skirmish=npc:<actor> quest=<context|by-actor-name> context=<name> npc=<actor> site=<caller> figure_kept_out=yes
//   tick(): twice a second, every actor within 40 m of a figure is read; a figure already inside such a fight (the actor's opponent is the
//     figure, or the engine's relation test says hostile in one skirmish) leaves that skirmish at once (RemoveSoulFromSkirmish), the mod's
//     forced targets and threats on that actor are dropped:
//       WO176-ARRANGED skirmish=npc:<actor> quest=context ... figure=kcd2mp_<n> figure_kept_out=removed skirmish_leave=done|FAILED
//
// Pipe ops in the WO-163 family (0x2B -> 0xAC), main thread:
